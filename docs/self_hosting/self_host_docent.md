# Self-host Docent

For most users, we recommend starting with the [public version](../quickstart.md) of Docent. We also provide white-glove hosting support for larger organizations; please [reach out](mailto:kevin@transluce.org?subject=Inquiry%20about%20Docent%20hosting) if you're interested.

### 1. Clone the repo and configure `.env`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TransluceAI/docent.git
cd docent
cp .env.template .env
```

You should now have a `.env` file at the project root. See [here for details on how to fill it in](./environment_variables.md).

!!! note
    If you're self-hosting Docent anywhere other than `localhost`, make sure to set the frontend URL as a CORS origin; e.g., `DOCENT_CORS_ORIGINS=http://domain:3001`.

### 2. Start the backend server and frontend UI

Docker Compose is the easiest way to get started, but you may want a manual installation to support faster development loops (e.g., for hot reloading).

=== "Docker Compose (recommended)"

    First ensure [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed. Then build and start the services:

    === "As non-root"
        ```bash
        DOCENT_HOST=http://localhost DOCENT_SERVER_PORT=8889 DOCENT_WEB_PORT=3001 docker buildx bake --load
        DOCENT_HOST=http://localhost DOCENT_SERVER_PORT=8889 DOCENT_WEB_PORT=3001 docker compose up -d
        ```

    === "As root"
        ```bash
        # Note that `sudo` strips environment variables, so you have to set them *inside* the command.
        sudo DOCENT_HOST=http://localhost DOCENT_SERVER_PORT=8889 DOCENT_WEB_PORT=3001 docker buildx bake --load
        sudo DOCENT_HOST=http://localhost DOCENT_SERVER_PORT=8889 DOCENT_WEB_PORT=3001 docker compose up -d
        ```

    !!! note
        If you're not using `localhost`, make sure `DOCENT_HOST` is set to the correct domain. Ensure that it's **prefixed correctly** with `http://` or `https://`.

    Once all containers are running, apply the database migrations:

    === "As non-root"
        ```bash
        docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
        ```

    === "As root"
        ```bash
        sudo docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
        ```

    You can verify all five containers are running with:

    === "As non-root"
        ```bash
        docker compose ps
        ```

    === "As root"
        ```bash
        sudo docker compose ps
        ```

    To shut Docent down, run:

    === "As non-root"
        ```bash
        docker compose down
        ```

    === "As root"
        ```bash
        sudo docker compose down
        ```

    !!! note
        If you make changes to the codebase, you'll need to stop the containers, then rebuild with `docker buildx bake --load` before starting again.

=== "Manual"

    If you don't already have Postgres and Redis installed, you can start them with Docker:

    === "As non-root"
        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose-db.yml up --build
        ```

    === "As root"
        ```bash
        sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-db.yml up --build
        ```

    after which Postgres and Redis will be available at the addresses set in [`.env`](./environment_variables.md). To set up your own databases, visit the official docs for [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/).

    Then run:

    === "uv"
        ```bash
        uv sync --extra dev
        ```

    === "pip"
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[dev]
        ```

    to install the core library, and

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

    to set up pre-commit hooks for development.

    Before running the application, you need to set up your database with Alembic migrations. First create a PostgreSQL database that matches the name in your `.env` file. Then run

    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

    to create all database tables. Now run

    === "Prod"
        ```bash
        docent_core server --port 8889 --workers 4
        ```

    === "Dev (with autoreload)"
        ```bash
        docent_core server --port 8889 --reload
        ```

    to start the API server,

    === "Prod"
        ```bash
        docent_core worker --workers 4 --queue all
        ```

    to start the worker, which handles background work, and

    === "Prod"
        ```bash
        docent_core web --build --port 3001 --backend-url http://localhost:8889
        ```

    === "Dev (with autoreload)"
        ```bash
        docent_core web --port 3001 --backend-url http://localhost:8889
        ```

    to start the frontend. You may need to [install Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation) first.

Finally, try accessing the Docent UI at `http://$DOCENT_HOST:$DOCENT_WEB_PORT`.

### 3. Customize the Docent client

When creating `Docent` client objects, you'll need to specify custom server and frontend URLs:

```python
import os
from docent import Docent

client = Docent(
    server_url="http://localhost:8889",    # or your own server URL
    frontend_url="http://localhost:3001",  # or your own frontend URL
    api_key=os.getenv("DOCENT_API_KEY"),
)
```

You're all set! Check out our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to get started.
