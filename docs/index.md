# Welcome to Docent

Docent provides tools to **summarize, cluster, and search** over agent transcripts. It automatically surfaces interesting observations, answers questions, and helps users form hypotheses about their agents.
<!-- It also provides infrastructure for **counterfactual experimentation** to test those hypotheses; users can modify and resume agents from past checkpoints. In the longer term, we anticipate that this experimental loop will be executed by AI systems themselves, with humans providing guidance. -->
