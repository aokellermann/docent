...

Based on this list, please propose a list of recurring themes where the first agent and the second agent consistently have different behaviors. Avoid repeating yourself in the output.
Try to choose recurring themes where the evidence for the theme clearly outweighs evidence in the reverse direction.

Themes should contain exactly one idea/concept each.
Themes should be mutually exclusive: no two themes should describe the same thing.
Themes should be collectively exhaustive: no item of the list should be left out.

Format your output in this format:

<theme_start>
Description of the theme and how it relates to agent 1 and agent 2
<theme_end>
<theme_start>
Description of the theme and how it relates to agent 1 and agent 2
<theme_end>
...
