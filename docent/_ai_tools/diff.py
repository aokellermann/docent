Here are two different sequences of actions an agent took to solve a task.
First transcript:
{transcript_1.to_str(transcript_idx_label=0)}
Second transcript:
{transcript_2.to_str(transcript_idx_label=1)}
Provide a CONCISE summary of key differences between the two transcripts. Do not re-explain individual transcripts.
We are interested in all kinds of key differences. Some examples (but you should not feel limited by these):
- Instances where one agent took actions that resulted in success while the other had critical mistakes or misconceptions
- Instances where one agent used tools in a very different way than the other
- Instances where one agent had very different higher-level strategies or approaches than the other
- Instances where one agent hallucinates a lot more than the other
- Significant differences in vibes or personality
Avoid repeating yourself in the output and avoid mentioning topics extremely similar to previously mentioned topics.
Always refer to the first transcript as "Agent 1" and the second as "Agent 2".
You are encouraged to cite evidence from the transcripts: {MULTI_BLOCK_CITE_INSTRUCTION}.
Avoid mentioning actions that both agents took, since that can never count as evidence for the two agents being different.
Format your output as follows:
Claim 1: agent 1 exhibits more of feature X than agent 2
Evidence 1: ways in which agent 1 is more of X than agent 2, with citations
Claim 2: agent 1 exhibits more of feature Y than agent 2
Evidence 2: ways in which agent 1 is more of Y than agent 2, with citations
