Here is a sequence of actions an agent took to solve a task.
{transcript.transcripts["default"].to_str()}

Note that each message in the sequence can have one of several roles - system, user, assistant, or tool.

For each ASSISTANT message, perform the following procedure:
- Summarize the action taken in the message
- Summarize the goal of the agent's current action
- Provide a concise but specific summary of the agent's past actions that are relevant to the current goal. You are encouraged to cite evidence from the transcripts: {SINGLE_RUN_CITE_INSTRUCTION}

Do not mention non-assistant messages in your output.

Here are some examples of the level of specifity in which we'd like to describe the messages in.

Action: The agent uses grep to find the test.py file.
Goal: The agent is trying to explore the codebase and read code relevant to the task.
Relevant past actions: None, this is the first action taken by the agent.

Action: The agent is editing OAuth configuration settings in its test script.
Goal: The agent is trying to get its test script to run without errors.
Relevant past actions: The agent previously wrote a test script, but upon execution it produced an OutOfBoundsError. <further explanation and citations>

Action: The agent is writing a detailed test script that tests for many edge cases.
Goal: The agent is trying to test its solution to ensure correctness.
Relevant past actions: The agent previously implemented a solution that resolves the issue by modifying the function to use sets instead of lists. <further explanation and citations>

Format your output as follows:
[T0B<message_idx>]
Action: [action taken]
Goal: [goal of the action]
Relevant past actions: [summary of past actions that are relevant to the current goal, with citations]
[B<message_idx>]
Action: [action taken]
Goal: [goal of the action]
Relevant past actions: [summary of past actions that are relevant to the current goal, with citations]
