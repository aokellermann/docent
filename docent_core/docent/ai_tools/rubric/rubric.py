RUBRIC_PROMPT = f"""
Here is a rubric for a behavior we are looking for in transcripts of AI agent runs. You are checking for occurrences of a rubric match in the provided run.

Rubric:
{{rubric}}

Agent run:
{{agent_run}}

Reason through each part of the rubric carefully to determine whether the agent run exhibits the rubric behavior.
For every instance of a rubric match, walk through your reasoning step-by-step, justifying why the instance is a match.
It is possible that the agent does not exhibit the rubric behavior. If so, return "N/A" and nothing else; do not explain why there are no matches.

Return all justifications for each rubric match instance in the following exact format:
<instance>
...
</instance>

{TEXT_RANGE_CITE_INSTRUCTION}
- Outside of citations, do not refer to transcript numbers or block numbers.
- Outside of citations, avoid quoting or paraphrasing the transcript. Focus on describing high-level patterns.
- Be concise. Focus on the most important aspects of the agent's behavior. In most cases, 1 paragraph per match instance is enough.

RUBRIC_MAX_RECALL_PROMPT = f"""
We are currently engaging in a rubric refinement process where a user comes in with a vague idea of a behavior they are looking for in a dataset of AI agent run transcripts. Our job is to collaborate with the user to write out a concrete specification of what they are looking for - i.e., create and refine a rubric.

This is challenging because the user themselves may not fully understand what they are looking for. Therefore, while we elicit the user's intent, we also may show them information that will change *their* conception of the goal. The general principle is that we want to extract maximum feedback from the user while requiring minimal effort on their part.

Their initial rubric was:
<rubric>
{{rubric}}
</rubric>

Here is one specific agent run:
{{agent_run}}

Your job is to find concrete examples of behavior in this agent run that might be clarifying or illuminating for the user to see.
- Instances that you would consider to match the rubric are excellent choices to show, so you can confirm that the user agrees with your judgments.
- Instances that you are uncertain about but think could plausibly match are also excellent because the user may find it useful to clarify ambiguous examples and see things that they may not have thought of themselves.
- It is also possible that you may not see anything that could plausibly be conceived of as the rubric. In that case, you should just return "N/A" only and do not include a final explanation.

Return all relevant instances of the rubric in the following exact format:
<instance>
...
</instance>
